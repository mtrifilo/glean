# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to making participation in the Decant project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and constructive in discussions and reviews.
- Assume good intent, ask clarifying questions, and avoid personal attacks.
- Give and accept feedback professionally.
- Focus on improving the project and helping other contributors.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory language.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Publishing private information without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of
Conduct. Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it privately to the
project maintainers. Do not post incident details publicly.

Reporting path:

1. Open a minimal issue titled `Code of Conduct report request`.
2. Do not include private or incident details in that issue.
3. A maintainer will move follow-up to a private channel.

All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled as confidentially as
possible.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including issues, pull
requests, code review comments, and other communication channels where the
project is represented.
