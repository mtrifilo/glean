## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately. Do not open a public issue.

Recommended path:

1. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting if available.
2. If unavailable, contact project maintainers through a private channel.

Please include:

- vulnerability description and potential impact
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- affected versions and environment details
- any suggested remediation if known

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible, investigate, and provide
status updates through the private reporting channel.
