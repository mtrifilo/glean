## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately. Do not open a public issue.

Recommended path:

1. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting:
   - `https://github.com/mtrifilo/glean/security/advisories/new`
2. If you cannot access that flow, open a minimal public issue titled:
   - `Security contact request`
   - Do not include vulnerability details.
   - A maintainer will move follow-up to a private channel.

Please include:

- vulnerability description and potential impact
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- affected versions and environment details
- any suggested remediation if known

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible, investigate, and provide
status updates through the private reporting channel.
