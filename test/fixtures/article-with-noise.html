      <h1>How Teams Adopt AI Assistants</h1>
      <p>
        Teams usually start with one high-friction workflow and add an assistant
        where context is easy to gather, such as documentation updates or test
        generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adoption improves when outputs are auditable and when prompts are treated
        like reusable assets. Successful teams write short operating guidelines
        that define acceptable output quality and review expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, assistants become more valuable as teams create fixture data,
        add command shortcuts, and build reliable cleanup tools that reduce noise
        before sending context to an LLM.
