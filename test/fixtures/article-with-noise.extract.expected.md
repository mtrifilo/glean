# How Teams Adopt AI Assistants

Teams usually start with one high-friction workflow and add an assistant where context is easy to gather, such as documentation updates or test generation.

Adoption improves when outputs are auditable and when prompts are treated like reusable assets. Successful teams write short operating guidelines that define acceptable output quality and review expectations.

Over time, assistants become more valuable as teams create fixture data, add command shortcuts, and build reliable cleanup tools that reduce noise before sending context to an LLM.
